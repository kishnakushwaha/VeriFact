"""
Verdict Engine Module with Accuracy Improvements

Computes the final verdict from collected evidence using weighted scoring.
Aggregates support/refute evidence and outputs confidence scores.
Includes explanation generation for transparency.

Accuracy improvements:
- Tuned decision thresholds (+0.35/-0.35 instead of ±0.4)
- Enhanced weighting formula with similarity boost
